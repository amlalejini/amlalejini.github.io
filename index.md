about_me: |
  I am currently a doctoral student working with Dr. Charles Ofria in the 
  [Digital Evolution Laboratory](http://devolab.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)
  in the departments of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.msu.edu/)
  and [Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, & Behavior](https://eebb.natsci.msu.edu/),
  and I am a member of the [BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action](https://beacon-center.org/).
  I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/)
  in 2015 where I worked with [Dr. Cindy Bethel](https://www.cindybethel.com/)
  in the [Social Therapeutic, and Robotic Systems (STaRS) Laboratory](http://www.stars.msstate.edu/). 

  As a computer scientist, I am awed by the diverse array of algorithms encoded in biological organisms. Our genomes are filled with algorithms capable of fantastic feats, such as cellular homeostasis, multicellular development, and even human intelligence. Traditionally in computer science, algorithms are designed by humans from conception to implementation, yet the capabilities of human-engineered algorithms often pale in comparison to biological organisms. 
  Broadly, my research focuses on the interplay between computer science and evolution:
  How does evolution produce the complex traits and behaviors we see in natural organisms? 
  And, how can we harness our understanding of natural evolution *in silico* to evolve
  computer programs as capable as biological organisms? 
  
  In my spare time, I enjoy tabletop gaming, traveling, and unathletically playing
  sportsball (*e.g.*, soccer, ultimate frisbee, *etc.*).
