  **My research intersects computer science and evolution, applying the principles of each field to advance the other.**

  Broadly, my research is driven by two questions:
  (1) How does evolution produce the complex traits and behaviors we see in natural organisms?
  And, (2) how can we harness our understanding of evolutionary processes to solve challenging problems?
  I apply digital evolution techniques to study how evolutionary processes work, and I use our understanding of evolution to develop evolutionary approaches to solving computational problems.

  I am currently a postdoc working with [Dr. Luis Zaman](https://zeeelab.com/) in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Michigan.
  In 2021, I completed a dual Ph.D. in Computer Science and Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior at Michigan State University (advisor: [Dr. Charles Ofria](http://devolab.msu.edu/)).
  I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science in 2015 at Mississippi State University (advisor: [Dr. Cindy Bethel](https://www.cindybethel.com/)).

  In my spare time, I enjoy tabletop gaming, traveling, and unathletically playing
  sportsball (*e.g.*, soccer, ultimate frisbee, *etc.*).
