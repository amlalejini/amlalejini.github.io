    "So far, we have been able to study only one evolving
    system and we cannot wait for interstellar flight to provide
    us with a second. If we want to discover generalizations
    about evolving systems, we will have to look to artificial
    ones." - [John Maynard Smith](https://doi.org/10.1038/355772a0).

overview: |
    My research resides somewhere at the intersection of artificial life, evolutionary biology, and evolutionary computation. 
    I am broadly interested in how evolutionary processes remain open-ended, continuously generating increasingly complex organisms. My work is a mishmash of using digital evolution to study
    general properties of evolving systems and of drawing inspiration from natural evolution and its byproducts to develop new evolutionary computation techniques and representations. Below are some of my current research projects. If anything is of interest to you, feel free to [contact me](#contact-me)!
