					My name is Alexander (Alex) Lalejini, and I am a fourth year computer science student at Mississippi State University. I have a 4.0 GPA and plan to graduate in the Spring of 2015. I am particularly interested in robotics and artificial intelligence; more specifically, I am interested in the application of biomimetics as applied to robotics and artificial intelligence. My interests have led me to become involved in the <a href="http://www.stars.msstate.edu/">Social, Therapeutic, and Robotics Systems (STaRS) Lab</a> at Mississippi State University where I work as an undergraduate research assistant.  Through the Naval Research Enterprise Internship Program, I worked in the <a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/lasr/">Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research</a> (LASR) at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington D.C. during the summer of 2014. In the past, I have interned at the Naval Research Laboratory at John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; I have also worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the physics department at Mississippi State University.

					Recently, my work has primarily involved programming with ROS Python â€“ the Python implementation of the Robot Operating System (ROS).  I have experience with applications development in Java, C++, and Python as well as web development using HTML/CSS, PHP, MySQL, and Java.

					<p class = "text_content">
					In my spare time, I enjoy tabletop gaming with friends, playing soccer with my intramural soccer team, and traveling.  Tabletop gaming is always a great way to spend an evening; some of my favorite games include Betrayal at House on the Hill, Magic: The Gathering, and Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game.  During the summer of 2013, I was able to travel to the City of London in the United Kingdom to study abroad where I lived and attended <a href="http://www.richmond.ac.uk/">Richmond University</a> for nine weeks.
