    Making a Game of It is a weeklong summer camp for high school students organized
    and run by Michigan State University.
    I, along with two other instructors (Josh Nahum and Matthew Andres Moreno),
    taught students Python. After two days of introductory material, students formed groups and designed & implemented
    their own video games. At the end of the camp, students presented their work
    to their peers and parents.
