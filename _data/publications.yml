        abstract="Lexicase selection is a proven parent-selection algorithm designed for genetic programming problems, especially for uncompromising test-based problems where many distinct test cases must all be passed. Previous work has shown that random subsampling techniques can improve lexicase selection's problem-solving success; here, we investigate why. We test two types of random subsampling lexicase variants: down-sampled lexicase, which uses a random subset of all training cases each generation; and cohort lexicase, which collects candidate solutions and training cases into small groups for testing, reshuffling those groups each generation. We show that both of these subsampling lexicase variants improve problem-solving success by facilitating deeper evolutionary searches; that is, they allow populations to evolve for more generations (relative to standard lexicase) given a fixed number of test-case evaluations. We also demonstrate that the subsampled variants require less computational effort to find solutions, even though subsampling hinders lexicase's ability to preserve specialists. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find any evidence of systematic loss of phenotypic diversity maintenance due to subsampling, though we did find evidence that cohort lexicase is significantly better at preserving phylogenetic diversity than down-sampled lexicase.",

        abstract = {We present SignalGP, a new genetic programming (GP) technique designed to incorporate the event-driven programming paradigm into computational evolution's toolbox. Event-driven programming is a software design philosophy that simplifies the development of reactive programs by automatically triggering program modules (event-handlers) in response to external events, such as signals from the environment or messages from other programs. SignalGP incorporates these concepts by extending existing tag-based referencing techniques into an event-driven context. Both events and functions are labeled with evolvable tags; when an event occurs, the function with the closest matching tag is triggered. In this work, we apply SignalGP in the context of linear GP. We demonstrate the value of the event-driven paradigm using two distinct test problems (an environment coordination problem and a distributed leader election problem) by comparing SignalGP to variants that are otherwise identical, but must actively use sensors to process events or messages. In each of these problems, rapid interaction with the environment or other agents is critical for maximizing fitness. We also discuss ways in which SignalGP can be generalized beyond our linear GP implementation.},

        abstract = {Many effective and innovative survival mechanisms used by natural organisms rely on the capacity for phenotypic plasticity; that is, the ability of a genotype to alter how it is expressed based on the current environmental conditions. Understanding the evolution of phenotypic plasticity is an important step towards understanding the origins of many types of biological complexity, as well as to meeting challenges in evolutionary computation where dynamic solutions are required. Here, we leverage the Avida Digital Evolution Platform to experimentally explore the selective pressures and evolutionary pathways that lead to phenotypic plasticity. We present evolved lineages wherein unconditional traits tend to evolve first; next, imprecise forms of phenotypic plasticity often ap-pear before optimal forms finally evolve. We visualize the phenotypic states traversed by evolved lineages across environments with differing rates of mutations and environmental change. We see that under all conditions, populations can fail to evolve phenotypic plasticity, instead relying on mutation-based solutions.},

        abstract = {As robotic systems become more sophisticated, they are increasingly called upon to accompany humans in high-stress environments. This research was conducted to support the integration of robotic systems into tactical teams operating in challenging and stressful environments. Robotic systems used to assist tactical teams will need to support some form of autonomy; these systems must be capable of providing operators supervisory control in cases of unpredictable real-time events. An evaluation of the relative effectiveness of three different methods of supervisory control of an autonomously operated mobile robot system was conducted: (1) hand gestures using a Microsoft Kinect, (2) an interactive Android application on a hand-held mobile device, and (3) verbal commands issued through a headset. These methods of supervisory control were compared to a teleoperated robot using a gamepad controller. The results from this pilot study determined that the touchscreen device was the easiest interface to use to override the robot's next intended movement (L2(3,23)=11.413, p=.003, d=1.58) and was considered the easiest interface to use overall (L2(3,23)=8.078, p=.044, d=.93). The results also indicate that the touchscreen device provided the most enjoyable, satisfying, and engaging interface of the four user interfaces evaluated.},

        abstract="MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven valuable for exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational problem. In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic traits of prospective solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits and maintains only the most fit organism found with those traits. The resulting map of trait combinations allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each trait relates to fitness and how traits interact. While MAP-Elites has not been demonstrated to be competitive for identifying the optimal Pareto front, the insights it provides do allow users to better understand the underlying problem. In particular, MAP-Elites has provided insight into the underlying structure of problem representations, such as the value of connection cost or modularity to evolving neural networks. Here, we extend the use of MAP-Elites to examine genetic programming representations, using aspects of program architecture as traits to explore. We demonstrate that MAP-Elites can generate programs with a much wider range of architectures than other evolutionary algorithms do (even those that are highly successful at maintaining diversity), which is not surprising as this is the purpose of MAP-Elites. Ultimately, we propose that MAP-Elites is a useful tool for understanding why genetic programming representations succeed or fail and we suggest that it should be used to choose selection techniques and tune parameters.",

        abstract="Tags are evolvable labels that provide genetic programs a flexible mechanism for specification. Tags are used to label and refer to programmatic elements, such as functions or jump targets. However, tags differ from traditional, more rigid methods for handling labeling because they allow for inexact references; that is, a referring tag need not exactly match its referent. Here, we explore how adjusting the threshold for how what qualifies as a match affects adaptive evolution. Further, we propose broadened applications of tags in the context of a genetic programming (GP) technique called SignalGP. SignalGP gives evolution direct access to the event-driven paradigm. Program modules in SignalGP are tagged and can be triggered by signals (with matching tags) from the environment, from other agents, or due to internal regulation. Specifically, we propose to extend this tag based system to: (1) provide more fine-grained control over module execution and regulation (e.g., promotion and repression) akin to natural gene regulatory networks, (2) employ a mosaic of GP representations within a single program, and (3) facilitate major evolutionary transitions in individuality (i.e., allow hierarchical program organization to evolve de novo).",
