    As a member of the Ground Vehicles Virtual Testbed Environment Project team,
    I helped to integrate the ANVEL Ground Vehicle Simulator with the Robot Operating System (ROS).
    This work enabled researchers to more easily perform human-robot interaction studies
    using the ANVEL platform.

- institution: Social, Therapeutic, and Robotic Systems (STaRS) Laboratory, Mississippi State University
  location: Starkville, MS
  position: Undergraduate research assistant
  dates: Fall 2013 - Summer 2015
  advisors: Cindy Bethel

    I worked as a project lead on the Robot Intent and Control Project where we
    studied the effectiveness of different human-robot interfaces for allowing 
    autonomous robots to communicate behavioral intentions to supervisory human
    operators who could optionally override the robot's behavior when necessary.
    Additionally, I assisted with other human-participant studies being run in the
    lab.

- institution: Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research (LASR), Naval Research Laboratory
  location: Washington, DC
  position: Intern
  dates: Summer 2014
  advisors: Greg Trafton and Laura Hiatt
  description: |
    I worked with cognitive scientists and image processing experts to research
    the effects of integrating contextual information (generated by a model of how
    humans learn associations between concepts) into a robot's object recognition
    system.

- institution: Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
  location: Pasadena, CA
  position: Intern
  dates: Summer 2012
  advisors: William R. Johnson
  description: |
    I developed software for a team of optics engineers and geoscientists.
    I focused on modernizing their instrument calibration software for their 
    Near-Nulling Radiometers, enabling the team to perform more efficient and 
    reliable calibrations.

- institution: Physics Department, Mississippi State University
  location: Starkville, MS
  position: Undergraduate research assistant
  dates: Fall 2011 - Spring 2012
  advisors: Angelle Tanner
