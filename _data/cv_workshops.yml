    These workshops started a conversation about identifying best practices for standardizing data storage
    in Artificial Life. We began developing data and tool standards for individuals who design, develop,
    and use a wide range of artificial life systems, including artificial chemistries,
    abstract ecologies, and evolutionary systems. We published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/isal_a_00213">a summary of the workshop outcomes</a>.
