                    Major evolutionary transitions change the fundamental way in which information is
                    stored and transmitted across generations, allowing for significant, innovative leaps in
                    biological complexity. These events are often cited as a mechanism by which biological
                    evolution remains open ended. In fraternal transitions, related individuals unite to
                    divide labor amongst themselves, behaving as a single, higher level individual. Examples
                    include the evolution of multicellularity or eusocial insect colonies. The goal of this
                    research project is to develop a digital evolution system that can be used to watch
                    fraternal transitions happen in <i>real-time</i>, allowing us to study the step-by-step
                    process by which fraternal transitions occur.

                      Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of a genotype to express different phenotypes
                      (<i>e.g.</i> traits or characteristics) in response to different environmental conditions.
                      Plasticity is often leveraged as a strategy to cope with heterogenous environments. In computer science,
                      our algorithms are often 'plastic' in the sense that they will often behave very differently
                      based on their inputs. In fact, we often get plasticity for free when we use things like 'if' statements.
                      I am using digital evolution to study the step-by-step process by which evolution develops plastic algorithms.
                      This work is exciting to me as a computer scientist interested in algorithms, but it's also of great interest
                      to evolutionary biologists, revealing stepping stones for the evolution of phenotypic plasticity that
                      are generalizable across both natural and computation systems. Here is a paper detailing some early results:

                    I worked as part of a research team on the Computational Research for Engineering
                    and Science Ground Vehicles Virtual Testbed Environment Project. The project
                    involved integrating the <a href="http://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System</a>
                    with the <a href="http://anvelsim.com/">ANVEL</a> Unmanned Ground Vehicle Simulator.
                    Our ultimate aim was to compare the results of human-robot interaciton studies carried out
                    in a virtual environment with human-robot interaction studies carried out in the real world.

                    I worked as a project co-lead on the Robot Intent and Control Project in the
                    Social, Therapeutic, and Robotic Systems Laboratory. When humans collaborate in a team
                    setting, the success of the team often depends on individual members of the team
                    being able to successfully communicate their intentions to their teammates. Additionally, as
                    the situations change, some teammembers may need to request other teammembers alter their behavior.
                    But, what if your teammate is a robot? What's the most effective way for your robot teammate to
                    convey its intentions to you? And, what is the most natural way to override those intentions when
                    necessary? The Robot Intent and Control Project addressed those exact questions. Read about our
