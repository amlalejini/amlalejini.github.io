Explanation of what this is and who it is for.
Overview of how I do supplemental material. Don't like pdf as a medium - just not as expressive and flexible as I'd like. Can't hold code, organize material in a non-linear way.

Things that i use, not an exhaustive list of things.
You'll notice no jupyter notebooks at the moment; those are great, I just don't use them very often because I'm more often using R + R markdown.

Reach out, send me suggestions!
